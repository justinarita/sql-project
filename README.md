SQL Project 

For my project, I'm proposing that I equip myself according to Apple's Product Marketing Business Analyst job post. They've been one of my favorite tech companies for many years now, and I believe in order to be the best, you have to learn from the best. I selected this job because it's a position that I would like to grow into over the course of my career. This position mainly requires a multifaceted, and highly motivated candidate who can perform quantitative and financial analysis in a product context. Apple is also looking to fill this position with someone who has superior Excel and modeling skills, as well as someone who has familiarity with data analyzation and manipulation (Tableau, SQL, Python). 
	The problem I plan to solve is the sales of the iPhone over the years. I want to specifically look at pricing, key features, and time of the year to see how these factors affect sales. This problem involves me taking in and analyzing data and then will require me to communicate information to teams around the company to drive business decisions for Apple. I will download data from Statista and use Google Trends API. I will clean the data in Excel and do my analysis through SQL, while coding my API through Jupyter Notebooks. I also want to do some visualization using Python or Tableau. This will all be hosted in an AWS RDS MySQL database.
